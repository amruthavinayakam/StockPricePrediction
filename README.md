# üìà Predicting Stock Price Movements Using Machine Learning: A Comparative Analysis

## üßæ Abstract

In the fast-paced landscape of entrepreneurship and finance, successful decision-making depends on understanding complex market dynamics. Traditional analysis often fails to capture subtle behavioral and data-driven trends. This research leverages **supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms**‚Äîincluding clustering and classification models‚Äîto identify hidden patterns in stock market data and enhance predictive accuracy.

The study specifically focuses on **Intel Corporation (INTC)** and compares the performance of several machine learning models under two trading strategies. The goal is to empower investors and analysts with **data-driven insights** that enable smarter trading and risk management.

## üéØ Objectives

* Predict stock price movements using supervised ML algorithms.
* Compare multiple classification models across two trading strategies.
* Evaluate model performance using accuracy, RMSE, MAE, MSE, and Sharpe Ratio.
* Identify the most efficient predictive model and trading approach.

## üß† Introduction

Predicting stock market movements has long been a challenge due to the volatile and nonlinear nature of financial data. Traditional approaches‚Äîfundamental and technical analysis‚Äîoften miss deeper data relationships. Machine learning enables models to **learn from historical trends**, identify correlations, and **forecast future price behavior** more accurately.

---

## üìö Background

Recent advancements in machine learning have introduced algorithms capable of processing complex financial datasets. Methods such as **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**, **Random Forests**, and **Neural Networks** have been applied successfully to model dependencies and relationships between price indicators, volatility, and volume trends.

By combining classical statistical models with deep learning, researchers can enhance both interpretability and predictive power.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The study employs two strategies for Intel Corp (INTC):

### **Strategy 1 ‚Äî Next-Day Price Prediction**

Predict whether the next trading day's closing price will be higher or lower than the current day's close.

### **Strategy 2 ‚Äî Moving Averages**

Compare the **50-day** and **200-day** moving averages to identify **bullish** and **bearish** signals.

---

### **Steps Followed**

1. **Data Acquisition:** Historical INTC data via the Yahoo Finance API.
2. **Preprocessing:** Cleaning missing values, formatting, adjusting for splits/dividends.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Deriving technical indicators and ratios.
4. **Label Generation:** Assigning "up" or "down" classes based on strategy.
5. **Model Selection:** Implementing ML classifiers and deep learning models.
6. **Evaluation:** Using test datasets and computing metrics (accuracy, RMSE, Sharpe Ratio).

## ü§ñ Models Used

* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classifies based on nearest data points.
* **Random Forest (RF):** Ensemble of decision trees; handles noise and complexity.
* **Gradient Boosting (GB):** Sequential tree-based learner improving residuals.
* **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** Finds optimal hyperplane for classification.
* **XGBoost:** Optimized gradient boosting with regularization.
* **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** Captures sequential dependencies and time lags.

Each algorithm was fine-tuned using **grid search** and **cross-validation** for hyperparameter optimization.

## üß© Implementation

**Data Retrieval:**
Historical data for INTC (Open, Close, High, Low, Volume) retrieved via Yahoo Finance API.

**Preprocessing:**
Data cleaning, normalization, and feature scaling performed to ensure consistency.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

* Trends and volatility visualization
* Moving averages and correlations
* Volume and return distribution
* Identification of anomalies or regime shifts
